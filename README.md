### Lab Assignment 6

[Lab Assignment 6 Project Folder](https://github.com/UnstableDiamond/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/s22magd150lab06_Cobb)

This project was made to experiment with the use of functions. The project theme is that of an 8-bit video game. The project itself displays character, background, and ground beneath the character. The project allows you to move the character using SPACE, the mouse, and the arrow keys. Some of the main components of the code are the functions created:
```
function drawBackground() {...}
function drawCharacter() {...}
function jump() {...}
...
```
